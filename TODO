STATUS
======

Works, but rough and incomplete
- implementation of request incomplete and improvable
- improper use of tools (SqlAlchemy, Bottle request objects)
- testing incomplete (and dependent on live database)
- poor formatting


Spec -- Missing
---------------
- needs support POST of JSON file for bulk upload


Spec -- Improve
Spec -- Improve
- validate data tag by tag
- implement queries -- several criteria


Usage / Design
--------------
- poor / idiosyncratic usage of 
    SQLAlchemy API
        session
        queries
    Bottle request object
- much non-pythonic code
- non-standard returns from Tag methods?


Testing
-------
- complete -- routes, model
- remove test dependent on live database
- test code against test database


Formatting
----------
- pylint / PEP8
- general code consolidation / pythonic
